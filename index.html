        <h2>Helpful Tips to Improve Your Golf Game</h2>
        <section class="tip1">
          <h3>Tip 1: Keep Your Head Down</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most common mistakes golfers make is lifting their head
            too soon after making contact with the ball. This can lead to
            mishits and inconsistent shots. To avoid this, focus on keeping your
            head down and your eyes on the ball until after you've completed
            your follow-through.

          <h3>Tip 2: Practice Your Short Game</h3>
          <p>
            While it's important to work on your long game, don't neglect your
            short game. Chipping and putting can make a big difference in your
            overall score. Spend time practicing these skills on the practice
            green and around the greens to improve your accuracy and confidence.

          <h3>Tip 3: Use Proper Grip and Stance</h3>
          <p>
            A proper grip and stance are essential for a good golf swing. Make
            sure you're holding the club correctly and that your feet are
            shoulder-width apart. This will help you maintain balance and
            control throughout your swing.

            <h3>Remember to Have Fun!</h3>
            <p>
              Golf is meant to be an enjoyable sport, so don't forget to have fun
              while you're out on the course. Whether you're playing with friends
              or just enjoying some time alone, focus on the positive aspects of
              the game and try not to get too frustrated with mistakes.
